Salutations. My name is Corina Dom√≠nguez and here I will describe my process for creating the chat bot demo:

This is a very simple demo of the basic function and apperance of the users interface.

I made the demos in javascript using the framework react and tailwind css.

- First I fetched the data from the API using the react hook useEffect and then filtered the ids.
- Then I made each demo as an individual react component that will receive two props, one for the API url and other for
the id.
- In each component I called again the API and with the id I filtered the user text and the bot answers, thanks to
the properties in the JSON.
- I printed every element of the conversation using the map method.
- Then I proceeded to create the UI, applying tailwind classes to every html element.
- I also applied some animations when every message appears on screen.
- Also, I made a simple test of how would be a reply, although is not completely functional, is just for show.
- I made every component with a different visual style.

And that's it, that's how I made the demo.
